Simple web application for storing a to-do list In the project I use mechanics such as:
    
    -spring-boot
    -maven for build and compile a project,
    -h2 database for data storage, e.g. language to choose and to-do list,
    -mapping database elements with hibernate,
    -simple JS scripts and html headers in index.html file for page frontend
