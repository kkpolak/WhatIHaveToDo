Simple web application for storing a to-do list In the project I use mechanics such as:
    
    -spring-boot
    -maven for build and compile a project,
    -h2 database for data storage, e.g. language to choose and to-do list,
    -mapping database elements with hibernate,
    -simple JS scripts and html headers in index.html file for page frontend

To build an application use the "mvn clean install" command
In the browser, you can run the application at: http://localhost:8080/
